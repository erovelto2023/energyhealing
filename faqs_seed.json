A general yoga teacher knows how to lead a flow; a yoga therapist understands pathology, contraindications, and how to adapt practices for safety and healing.",
            "application": "If you have a general goal of flexibility, a yoga class is great. If you have sciatica, PTSD, or a heart condition, yoga therapy offers a safe, medically-informed protocol designed specifically for that diagnosis."
